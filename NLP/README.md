# NLP Analysis Project

This project aims to demonstrate the understanding and application of basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text data analysis. We will perform NLP analysis on various tasks, including Name Entity Recognition (NER), word frequency analysis, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis using different sources of text data.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to apply basic NLP techniques to analyze text data and extract meaningful insights. The project consists of three tasks:

1. Name Entity Recognition (NER) Analysis:
   - Select an article from a website of your interest.
   - Perform NER analysis on the article to identify and extract named entities.
   - Show the necessary output and visualization.
   - Explain your findings and discuss any shortcomings or errors in the algorithm's output.

2. Word Frequency and Keyword Extraction Analysis:
   - Select a research paper of your interest.
   - Perform word frequency analysis and extract keywords using at least three different techniques or libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn).
   - Show the necessary output and visualization.
   - Explain your findings and compare the different techniques.
   - Mention any shortcomings or errors in the algorithm's output, if applicable.

3. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data:
   - Choose a keyword of your interest.
   - Collect at least 1000 tweets related to the keyword from Twitter.
   - Clean the tweets and store them in a CSV file.
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine the overall positive and negative sentiment counts.
   - Display one positive and one negative sentiment tweet and discuss the accuracy of the sentiment analysis algorithm.
   - Display the tweet with the highest retweets and show its sentiment.
   - Create a timeline visualization plot showing the counts of positive and negative sentiments over time.

By completing this project, we will have gained practical experience in applying basic NLP techniques to analyze text data. We will have explored NER, word frequency analysis, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis using various sources of text data. The project will provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of these NLP techniques, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions from textual information.
