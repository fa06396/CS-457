# Data Wrangling Project

This project focuses on data wrangling using the Pandas library in Python. The goal is to clean up a messy dataset and gain useful insights from the data. Data wrangling is an essential skill in data analytics, and this project demonstrates its practical application.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to format and clean the "580SurveyCleanup.csv" dataset. The dataset contains a survey with 12 questions (referred to as Q1-Q12), and the task is to perform data cleaning operations to handle missing values, whitespace, capitalization, and other inconsistencies in the data.

### Dataset Description

The "580SurveyCleanup.csv" dataset is provided as the initial input for this project. It represents the survey data collected from participants, but it requires cleaning to remove inconsistencies and make it ready for analysis. The dataset may contain missing values, inconsistent formatting, and other data quality issues.

### Project Tasks

The project can be divided into the following tasks:

1. Format the dataset: In this step, we will format the "580SurveyCleanup.csv" dataset to ensure consistency and uniformity across columns and values. This includes handling whitespace, capitalization, and multiple names for the same entity.

2. Missing value handling: We will investigate each column with missing values and determine the most suitable method to fill in the missing values. This step requires careful analysis and consideration of the data characteristics.

3. Data cleaning: The dataset may have various inconsistencies that need to be addressed. This includes handling whitespace, converting text to the desired case (upper/lower/title), and resolving multiple names of the same entity.

4. Statistical summaries: Using the cleaned dataset from the previous steps, we will prepare statistical summaries for Questions Q1-Q12. This involves computing counts, means, unique values, and other relevant statistics for each question.

5. Insights and storytelling: Based on the statistical summaries, we will derive useful insights and craft a compelling narrative for each question. We will refer to the "580SurveyQuestion.pdf" file, which provides the actual survey questions, to enhance the storytelling and engage the audience.
