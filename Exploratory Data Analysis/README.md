# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, including the creation of statistical tables and visualizations. The goal is to explore and gain insights from the "loan_small.csv" dataset, and to tell interesting stories based on the analysis.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the "loan_small.csv" dataset. The dataset contains information about loans, and we will leverage Python and various EDA techniques to clean the data, create statistical tables, and generate meaningful visualizations.

### Dataset Description

The "loan_small.csv" dataset is provided as the input for this project. It contains attributes related to loans, such as loan status, employment length, and months since last delinquency. The dataset may have missing values and inconsistent formatting, which need to be addressed during the data cleaning process.

### Project Tasks

The project can be divided into the following tasks:

1. Data cleaning: We will clean the dataset by addressing specific issues. For example, we will exclude the "months" text from the "term" attribute, clean the "emp_length" attribute to make it numerical, and convert the "loan_status" attribute into a binary attribute (e.g., "good" or "bad") based on given values. Additionally, we will handle missing values in attributes such as "mths_since_last_delinq" and "mths_since_last_record" through imputation.

2. Statistical tables: Using the cleaned dataset, we will generate appropriate summary tables using the group keyword in Pandas. These tables will include relevant statistics such as counts, means, medians, or modes. We will aim to create at least two tables that provide valuable insights or analysis results.

3. Univariate analysis: We will create suitable visualizations for univariate analysis, including at least one bar chart and one histogram. These visualizations will help us understand the distribution and characteristics of individual attributes.

4. Bivariate analysis: We will explore the relationships between different attributes through bivariate analysis. This will involve creating at least one scatter plot to analyze the relationship between continuous variables, at least one visualization for the relationship between discrete and continuous variables, and one correlation plot to assess the correlation between attributes.

5. Multivariate visualization (optional): If desired, we can also generate a multivariate visualization to explore relationships among multiple attributes simultaneously.

**Note:** You can select attributes based on your imagination and domain knowledge to perform interesting univariate and bivariate analyses.
