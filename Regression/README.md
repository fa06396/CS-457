# Regression Project

This project aims to demonstrate the understanding and application of regression techniques for correlation and prediction. We will use the "EmployeeSalaryRegression.csv" dataset to perform regression analysis and draw insights related to various questions.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to apply regression techniques to the "EmployeeSalaryRegression.csv" dataset. The dataset contains various attributes related to employees, such as TotalWorkingYears, MonthlyIncome, Age, DistanceFromHome, HourlyRate, and others. By creating regression models, we will explore correlations and predict target variables based on input features.

### Dataset Description

The "EmployeeSalaryRegression.csv" dataset is provided as the input for this project. It includes attributes related to employees' salaries and other relevant information. We will utilize this dataset to perform regression analysis and draw insights related to the provided questions.

### Project Tasks

The project can be divided into the following tasks:

1. Regression model between TotalWorkingYears and MonthlyIncome:
   - Create a regression model to analyze the relationship between TotalWorkingYears and MonthlyIncome.
   - Show a scatter plot with the regression line between the two variables.
   - Interpret the coefficients, p-values, R-squared, and other relevant information to support the answer.

2. Regression model between Age and DistanceFromHome:
   - Create a regression model to analyze the relationship between Age and DistanceFromHome.
   - Show a scatter plot with the regression line between the two variables.
   - Interpret the coefficients, p-values, R-squared, and other relevant information to support the answer.

3. Correlation calculation and explanation:
   - Calculate the correlation between TotalWorkingYears and MonthlyIncome (from Question 1) and between Age and DistanceFromHome (from Question 2).
   - Explain the correlation values to support the answer.

4. Regression model to predict MonthlyIncome:
   - Create a regression model to predict MonthlyIncome using all other inputs.
   - Discuss the effectiveness of the model.
   - Report the three most significant inputs and the three least significant inputs based on p-values.
   - Interpret the results.
   - Create a new input and show the prediction of MonthlyIncome using the same model.

5. Regression model to predict HourlyRate:
   - Create a regression model to predict HourlyRate using all other inputs.
   - Discuss the effectiveness of the model.
   - Report the three most significant inputs and the three least significant inputs based on p-values.
   - Interpret the results.
   - Create a new input and show the prediction of HourlyRate using the same model.

6. Regression model with selected inputs:
   - Select the top three inputs from Question 4 based on p-values.
   - Create a new regression model to predict MonthlyIncome using only these inputs.
   - Discuss the performance of the model compared to using all inputs in Question 4.
   - Explain which model you prefer and why.
   - Research and study "Regularization in Regression" to understand the concept of creating a simple generalized model with fewer inputs.

7. Prediction of MonthlyIncome with new data records:
   - Using the model with three inputs from Question 6, create two new data records.
   - Predict their MonthlyIncome using the model.
   - Discuss if the predicted outputs make sense based on the new data records.
